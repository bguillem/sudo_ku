# general-info

This project is mostly here because I wanted to learn Python and I was bored, a rainy sunday in Paris. I wanted to do the simplest code I could so it would be easy enough to read and understand.
I might change some stuff later because the output is not clean. So i might write a function for this later, but this project is pretty much finished.

# usage

The script takes a file as an argument that should be formatted as such :

```
000100003
500600700
090080021
040200109
206070000
000000000
000000000
```

The zeroes represent empty spots the script should fill.

To execute the script, please type :

```bash
python sudo_ku.py map
```
